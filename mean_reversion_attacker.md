# Mean Reversion Attacker Tutorial

This tutorial demonstrates how to create an "attacker" that exploits deviations from the martingale property in a univariate numerical time series. By identifying when the expected future value of a series diverges from its current value, the attacker aims to make profitable predictions with minimal trading frequency.

## Introduction

In financial time series analysis, a martingale represents a model where the best prediction for the next value is simply the current value, expressed as $E[x_{t+1}] = x_t$. However, real-world data often deviate from this property due to trends, cycles, or mean-reverting behaviors. Detecting these deviations presents opportunities for building trading strategies that can capitalize on predictable patterns.

The goal of this tutorial is to build an efficient online (incremental) algorithm that can detect such deviations in real-time. By processing data as it streams in and updating internal states incrementally, the attacker can make timely predictions without the need for extensive computational resources.

## Overview of the Attacker Strategy

The attacker employs a mean reversion strategy based on an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) of past data:

- **State Maintenance**: The attacker keeps track of the current value and an EWMA of historical values. This is achieved using a smoothing parameter $a$, which determines the weight given to recent observations.

- **Prediction Logic**: When the current value significantly deviates from the running average, the attacker predicts a reversal. Specifically:
  - If the current value is higher than the running average by a certain threshold, predict a decrease (-1).
  - If the current value is lower than the running average by the threshold, predict an increase (+1).
  - Otherwise, make no prediction (0).

This approach assumes that extreme deviations from the mean are likely to revert, a common phenomenon in financial markets known as mean reversion.

## Building Efficient Online Algorithms

To serve the purpose of detecting martingale deviations efficiently, the algorithm must process data incrementally and update predictions in real-time. Here are some ideas and considerations for building such algorithms:

- **Incremental Statistics**: Utilize online algorithms that update statistics with each new data point without storing the entire history. The EWMA is a prime example, as it can be updated using the formula:
  $$\text{running\_avg} \leftarrow (1 - a) \times \text{running\_avg} + a \times x_t$$

- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Implement thresholds that adapt based on the volatility of the data. This can be achieved by maintaining an online estimate of the standard deviation and adjusting the threshold proportionally.

- **Feature Engineering**: Incorporate additional features such as momentum indicators, rolling variances, or online regression coefficients. These features can be updated incrementally and may improve prediction accuracy.

- **Parallel Processing**: If handling multiple data streams, design the algorithm to process streams in parallel, leveraging multi-core processors or distributed computing frameworks.

- **Resource Management**: Optimize memory usage by avoiding the storage of historical data points. Use data structures that support efficient incremental updates.

- **Algorithm Selection**: Choose algorithms that are known for their efficiency in online settings. For example, online versions of algorithms like stochastic gradient descent can be more suitable than batch counterparts.

## Utilizing Online Learning Libraries

While the `river` package is a powerful tool for online machine learning and stream processing, other libraries can also be considered:

- **scikit-multiflow**: An open-source framework specifically designed for learning from data streams, offering tools for classification, regression, and concept drift detection.

- **PyTorch with Streaming Extensions**: For deep learning models, PyTorch can be adapted to handle streaming data through mini-batch updates and stateful recurrent architectures.

- **Custom Implementations**: For specific use cases, custom online algorithms may provide better performance and flexibility than general-purpose libraries.

## Practical Implementation

The notebook follows these steps:

1. **Initializing the Attacker**: We start by defining a custom attacker class, `MyAttacker`, which inherits from `AttackerWithSimplePnL`. This base class provides basic accounting for profit and loss.

2. **Implementing the `tick` Method**: The `tick` method updates the attacker's state with each new data point, maintaining the current value and updating the EWMA.

3. **Defining the `predict` Method**: The `predict` method uses the mean reversion logic to decide whether to predict an increase, decrease, or no change.

4. **Testing on Mock Data**: Before applying the algorithm to real data, we test it on synthetic data to validate the logic and ensure that the state updates and predictions are working as intended.

5. **Applying to Real Data**: The attacker is run on streaming data generated by `stream_generator`, simulating a real-world scenario where data arrives incrementally.

6. **Parameter Optimization**: We optimize the smoothing parameter $a$ using the `scipy.optimize` library to maximize total profit on training data. This involves running the attacker across multiple streams and adjusting $a$ to find the optimal value.

7. **Evaluating on Test Data**: The optimized parameter is then tested on unseen data to evaluate the attacker's generalization capability.

## Observations and Challenges

While the attacker showed profitability on the training data, applying the same parameters to the test data resulted in losses. This outcome suggests potential overfitting to the training data or that the simple mean reversion strategy may not generalize well across different datasets.

To address this, consider the following:

- **Cross-Validation**: Implement cross-validation techniques tailored for time series data, such as time-based splits, to better assess the model's performance.

- **Enhancing the Model**: Incorporate additional features or more sophisticated algorithms that can capture complex patterns beyond simple mean reversion.

- **Regularization**: Apply regularization methods to prevent overfitting and improve generalization to new data.

## Conclusion

Building efficient online algorithms for detecting deviations from the martingale property involves a balance between simplicity and adaptability. By maintaining minimal state and updating incrementally, the attacker can process streaming data in real-time with low computational overhead. While the initial results highlight the challenges of generalizing to new data, they also open avenues for enhancing the algorithm through feature engineering, adaptive methods, and leveraging advanced online learning libraries.

This tutorial serves as a foundation for developing more robust strategies that can adapt to the dynamic nature of real-world data streams. By exploring additional tools and refining the approach, it's possible to build algorithms that are both efficient and effective in exploiting market inefficiencies.
